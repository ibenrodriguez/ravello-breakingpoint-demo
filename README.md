#Overview
                    
BreakingPoint Virtual Edition is a software-based test platform that enables you to run a BreakingPoint vController and traffic generation blades on a virtual chassis.
                    
BreakingPoint Virtual Edition offers the following benefits:
- Low Hardware Cost - You can use low-cost servers or dedicated virtualization servers to generate the traffic.
- More Efficient use of Hardware - The same servers used to generate Ixia traffic can also be used for other non- Ixia applications; or the virtual Ixia ports can be hosted on a virtualization server used to host other applications.
- Ease of Use â€“ The BreakingPoint Virtual Edition GUI is nearly identical to the standard hardware versions, reducing the learning time.
- Reduced System Administration - The BreakingPoint Virtual Edition chassis does not need be maintained or monitored in a lab because it is virtual in nature.
- Rapid and Easy Deployment - Virtual Ixia ports can be instantiated as necessary, used to generate traffic, and then destroyed when no longer needed.
- BreakingPoint Virtual Edition is delivered as a pre-configured .ova template.    

#Basic Elements

The basic elements involved in the BreakingPoint Virtual Edition are:

- A simple installer based on a single OVA image or installation script.
- Deployment and discovery tools for easy provisioning of Virtual Blades (vBlades). l A license server that also runs on the BreakingPoint vController.
- vBlades for virtualization of load modules using a single management interface with from two to eight virtual test ports
- vController for virtualization of the System Controller:
  - Controls up to 12 vBlades and up to 96 vPorts
  - Controls vBlades spanning across different physical servers

#Setup Notes: 

- http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network
- Ravello's service currently does not support DHCP for ESXi's nested vms.
  - As you can see, for now you can either use a static IP's for the ESXi or create your own DHCP server for this purpose.
